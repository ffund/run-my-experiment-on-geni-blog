In this experiment you will reproduce a key result of D. Xia, J. Hart, and Q. Fu, “Evaluation of the Minstrel rate adaptation algorithm in IEEE 802.11g WLANs,” in _2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)_, IEEE, Jun. 2013 ([URL](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6654858)). Specifically, you will show that under static channel conditions, the Minstrel rate adaptation algorithm achieves comparable performance to the best-performing fixed rate at all power levels.


It should take about 150-180 minutes to run this experiment, but you will need to have reserved that time in advance. This experiment uses wireless resources, and you can only use wireless resources on ORBIT during a reservation. 

To reproduce this experiment on GENI, you will need an account on the [GENI Portal](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/SignMeUp), and you will need to have [joined a project](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/JoinAProject). You should have already [uploaded your SSH keys to the portal](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/HowTo/LoginToNodes). The project lead of the project you belong to must have enabled wireless for the project. Finally, you must have reserved time on [Open-Access Research Testbed for Next-Generation Wireless Networks (ORBIT)](https://geni.orbit-lab.org/) and you must run this experiment during your reserved time. To reserve time on this testbed, log in to [ORBIT](https://geni.orbit-lab.org/) by choosing “Log in using GENI credentials”.

The optimal rate depends on the link quality. Higher order modulation and coding schemes have better spectral efficiency, so they are able to transmit more data in the same bandwidth-time resource. However, they are also less resilient to noise and interference on the link. When the link quality is good, a high rate works great, but when the channel quality is poor, those high rates experience excessive packet drops due to bit errors, so they will have lower throughput than a more conservative modulation and coding scheme. On the other hand, switching to a very low rate when the signal quality is poor is not necessarily optimal. If there is bursty interference, then a packet transmitted at a lower order modulation and coding scheme will take longer to send, and therefore is more likely to encounter a burst of interference. A higher order modulation and coding scheme ``pushes'' the packet much faster and reduces the probability of collision.

Wireless links constantly vary, due to factors such as distance between transmitter and receiver, interference, and multipath effects. Thus, they need _rate adaptation_ algorithms to choose the most appropriate rate for the current channel, and adapt to changing channel quality. One simple approach is to assign rates based on a pre-determined mapping of rate to signal quality index, with lower signal qualities assigned lower rates because they are more resilient to error. Alternatively, some devices may use a step-up/step-down approach, where the rate is decreased if excessive packet loss occurs and increased if packet loss is very low. However, these techniques may actually decrease throughput when there is bursty interference (or any other loss mechanism where loss probability increases with transmission time).

In contrast, the Minstrel rate adaptation algorithm (described [here](https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/developers/documentation/mac80211/ratecontrol/minstrel)) is designed to work well whether the dominant source of loss is one where a lower rate performs better (e.g. if there is low received signal strength due to path loss) or one where a higher rate performs better (e.g. if there is bursty interference). 

For each rate _R_, Minstrel records the empirical probability of successful transmission <i>p<sub>R</sub></i> - the ratio of transmission attempts to acknowledgements received at that rate - using an exponential weighted moving average. Then, the estimated throughput is calculated according to 

$$ T_R = \frac{p\_R}{d\_R} $$

where <i>d<sub>R</sub></i> is the duration of a single frame transmission at rate _R_. The values for <i>T<sub>R</sub></i> are stored in a table, and at frequent intervals this table is consulted to determine the best rate at which to transmit over the next interval. Also, for 10% of frames, Minstrel "looks around" by sending at  different rates in order to update its statistics. In this way, the "best" transmission rate is updated when link conditions change.

Table 2 shows an example of the table maintained by Minstrel:

The "rate" column is the 802.11g rate. The rates that have the highest, 2nd highest, 3rd highest, and 4th highest throughput respectively are denoted with A, B, C, and D. Also, the rate with the highest delivery probability is denoted with P. The "throughput" column is the most recent throughput estimate for that rate in Mbps. The probability of successful transmission <i>p<sub>R</sub></i> over the last interval is shown as a percentage in the "EWMA prob" column, while the "this prob" column shows the success ratio over the last interval. The column labeled "this succ/attempt" shows number of the successful and attempted frames per rate during the interval. Finally, "success" and "attempts" are the number of successful and attempted frames per rate since startup.



## Results

In [Xia et al. 2013](#references), it is claimed that under static channel conditions, the Minstrel rate adaptation algorithm achieves comparable throughput to the best-performing fixed rate at all power levels. The throughput of Minstrel and fixed rates are given in Fig. 1 for a range of TX power levels.

<small> Figure 1 : Throughput with a static channel from [Xia et al. 2013](#references) </small>

Fig. 2 shows the frequency with which different rates are attempted by Minstrel over a static channel for the same range of TX power levels.  [Xia et al. 2013](#references) notes that during poor channel conditions, Minstrel uses the lower data rates more often. In this scenario, packet drops are most often due to path loss from lower transmit power, not bursty interference, so the more packets are dropped at higher data rates.

## Run my experiment

In this experiment we will examine the Minstrel rate adaptation algorithm in a static channel, for a range of transmit powers. 

For this experiment we will need two hosts equipped with Atheros 5k series wireless cards. The ORBIT testbed has multiple sandboxes that are equipped with this device. However, in order to see the effect of varying transmit power, the hosts must be sufficiently far away from each other. Otherwise, even with the lowest TX power setting, the channel is good enough to accommodate all transmission rates! For this purpose, the "grid" facility at ORBIT is a good choice as it has many nodes equipped with Atheros 5k wireless interfaces, and it is possible to select nodes so that the distance between them is large enough to observe rate changes. In my experiment I selected node1-1 and node5-5.You can verify the availability of nodes and their capabilities as follows:

* Visit [ORBIT](http://geni.orbit-lab.org) and log in
* Click on "Control Panel"
* Click on "Status Page"
* Choose the "grid" tab
* Scroll down to the "WiFi" panel, and check the box next to "Ath5k". (This will mark with an X any node has a WiFi interface in the Atheros 5xxx family.)

In the display, nodes that are available are shown as blue or green squares; nodes that are not available are shown as red squares. You can find out the name of a node by clicking on it, and then looking at the "Info" panel on the left. Use this information to make substitutions in the instructions, replacing unavailable nodes (if any; shown as red squares) with nearby available nodes that have Atheros 5xxx cards.

At your reserved time, SSH into the "grid" console, substituting the bold parts of the command below for your own username and path to the key with which you log in to GENI resources:

<pre>
ssh geni-<b>USERNAME</b>@grid.orbit-lab.org -i <b>/PATH/TO/KEY</b>
</pre>

(recall that your GENI wireless username is your regular GENI username, with a "geni-" prefix).
 
### Prepare the testbed

Load the “wifi-experiment.ndz” disk image onto two testbed nodes: node1-1 and node5-5. From the grid console, run:

<pre>
omf-5.4 load -i wifi-experiment.ndz -t node5-5.grid.orbit-lab.org,node1-1.grid.orbit-lab.org
</pre>

When this process finishes successfully, turn the nodes on with

<pre>
omf tell -a on -t node1-1.grid.orbit-lab.org,node5-5.grid.orbit-lab.org
</pre>

This will take several minutes as actual physical devices are booting up on our testbed. Open two terminals. In each, SSH into the grid console as aforementioned, and from there, into each of the nodes (with username "root"), i.e.

<pre>
ssh root@node1-1
</pre>

and

<pre>
ssh root@node5-5
</pre>


We need to see which interface is associated with the ath5k-series wireless card. On each of the nodes, run
<pre>
modprobe ath5k
</pre>
to activate the ath5k-series interface. Then to find out the name of this interface, for each node, run
<pre>
lshw -class network | grep -A 9 "product: AR5"  | grep "logical" | awk '{print $3}'
</pre>
This command lists the logical name of the interface associated with the Atheros 5XXX NIC, e.g. `wlan0` or `wlan1`. Verify that this command produces a logical interface name as its output - if not, the subsequent commands won't work properly.

One node is designated to act as the wireless access point (AP). I used node1-1 for this. On the terminal of this node, run
<pre>
ifconfig $(lshw -class network | grep -A 9 "product: AR5"  | grep "logical" | awk '{print $3}') up
</pre>
Then, bring up an access point on channel 11 with
<pre>
create_ap -g 192.168.1.1 -c 11 -n $(lshw -class network | grep -A 9 "product: AR5"  | grep "logical" | awk '{print $3}') minstrel-exp
</pre>

and leave this running.  You should see several lines of output ending with

```
ap0: AP-ENABLED 
```

Log in to the other node. On this node, node5-5, you will need to connect to the wireless network we previously created, and set up the IP address. Run
<pre>
ifconfig $(lshw -class network | grep -A 9 "product: AR5"  | grep "logical" | awk '{print $3}') up
</pre>
to bring up the interface. Then connect to wireless access point with ESSID "minstrel-exp" that is operating on channel 11:
<pre>
iwconfig $(lshw -class network | grep -A 9 "product: AR5"  | grep "logical" | awk '{print $3}') essid minstrel-exp channel 11
</pre>
and check the connection by running
<pre>
iwconfig $(lshw -class network | grep -A 9 "product: AR5"  | grep "logical" | awk '{print $3}')
</pre>
and observe the output. It should contain “minstrel-exp” as ESSID, and the MAC address of the other node in the "Access Point" field, like this:


```
wlan0     IEEE 802.11abg  ESSID:"minstrel-exp"  
          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.462 GHz  Access Point: 00:60:B3:25:C0:15   
          Bit Rate=6 Mb/s   Tx-Power=27 dBm   
          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Encryption key:off
          Power Management:off
          Link Quality=34/70  Signal level=-76 dBm  
          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:1   Missed beacon:0
```

Then set an IP address on this interface:
<pre>
ifconfig $(lshw -class network | grep -A 9 "product: AR5"  | grep "logical" | awk '{print $3}') 192.168.1.5
</pre>


To verify that the two are connected, on the STA device (node5-5), run

<pre>
ping -c 5 192.168.1.1
</pre>

and make sure the ping replies are received.

### Run the experiment

We will transfer data from the AP to the STA and measure throughput at different rates and transmit power levels.

First, at the STA (node5-5), run

<pre>
iperf -s -u | tee iperf_receiver_output.txt
</pre>
to monitor the output and write it to the iperf\_receiver\_output.txt file.

Second, at the AP (node1-1), run
<pre>
nano run.sh
</pre>
which creates a file named `run.sh` and opens it for editing. Paste the following script into this file:

<pre>
#!/bin/bash

# Find the file that informs about Minstrel rate control statistics
RCSFILE=$(find /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/ -name "rc_stats")
# Find the file to which we will write the fixed rate index
IDXFILE=/sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/$(echo $RCSFILE | cut -d '/' -f 6)/rc/fixed_rate_idx

# Loop over different fixed rate indices (and -1 for Minstrel)
for j in {-1,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0}; do
  # Loop over different TX power values
  for i in {17,15,13,11,9,7,5,3,1,0}; do
    echo ${j} > "$IDXFILE"
    echo "TX power $i, rate $(cat $IDXFILE)"
    iwconfig ap0 txpower ${i} # Set TX power
    # Run iperf, save output to file
    iperf -c 192.168.1.5 -i 1 -t 120 -u -b 50M > iperf_rate_${j}_power_${i}.txt
    if [ "$j" -lt "0" ]
    then
      # If using Minstrel, save rate control statistics to file
      cat $RCSFILE > minstrel_rc_power_${i}.txt
    fi
    sleep 10
  done
done

# Create an archive with all experiment data
tar -czf minstrel-experiment-data.tgz *.txt
</pre>

Press Ctrl+O and then Enter to save the file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit the editor.

Then, run

<pre>
bash run.sh
</pre>

to run the experiment script.


### Data analysis and visualization

First, parse the data from all the `iperf` output files into a CSV file. On the STA node, run

<pre>
grep " ms " iperf* | sort -t"_" -n -k3 -k5 | sed 's/:/ /' | awk '{print $1","$8}' |  awk -F '[_.,]' '{print $5","$7"."$8","$3}' > power-tput-rate.csv
</pre>


Next, we will use gnuplot to plot the data:
<pre>
gnuplot
set term svg
set datafile separator ","
plot "power-tput-rate.csv" using 1:2:3 with labels,  "power-tput-rate.csv" using 1:2:3 with lines linecolor palette

</pre>



Finally, use `scp` to transfer the files generated by the experiment and the figures that you have just created to your console. For example, if the STA node was node5-5, run the following on the testbed console (NOT on the STA):

```
scp root@node5-5:~/minstrel-experiment-data.tgz .
scp root@node5-5:~/*.svg .
```

### 4. Data Analysis
I used Python 3 to analyze the data. Python is available online for free for almost any platform [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The version I have is 3.6.7,but as long as you have a python 3 version this code should work when the required libraries are installed. I will write the analysis according to linux, however it is easy to find commands to install libraries on their respective websites for pretty much any platform. After installing python3 according to the instructions on the [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) in a local terminal run
<pre>
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install matplotlib
</pre>
after the installation is complete we are set to analyze the data. To analyze the throughput on the same location where the output files reside run
<pre>
nano tpt.py
</pre>
and write down this script
<pre>

plt.legend(legend)
plt.gca().invert_xaxis()

save the file. Similarly create another python file by running

After copying the scripts, on the terminal run
<pre>
python3 tpt.py
</pre>
and this will produce Fig. 4.

<small> Figure 4 : (Reproduced) Throughput with a static channel </small>

Similarly run,
<pre>
python3 usage_stats.py
</pre>
and this will produce Fig. 5.
![](/blog/content/images/2019/06/Figperct.svg)
<small> Figure 4 :  (Reproduced) Minstrel rate selection breakdown in a static channel </small>

The trend is similar between the figures on the [(Xia et al. 2013)](#references) and figures produced from the experiment. Minstrel performs comparable to the best performing fixed modulation coding scheme in every power level for both of the figures. Similarly the rate breakdown in my figure follows the same trend with the figure on [(Xia et al. 2013)](#references).

## Notes

### Software versions

This experiment was developed on the following software versions:

* Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS x86\_64  GNU/Linux
* Linux kernel 3.13.0-108-generic
* Python 3.6.7 (Python 3)
* Numpy 1.16.0
* matplotlib 3.0.3

### Using another testbed

This experiment will also work on the "sb4" testbed at ORBIT, which currently has five Atheros 5xxx-equipped nodes: node1-1, node1-2, node1-7, node1-8, and node1-9. If using "sb4", when you first log in to the "sb4" console you should run

```
wget -qO- "http://internal2dmz.orbit-lab.org:5054/instr/setAll?att=0"

wget -qO- "http://internal2dmz.orbit-lab.org:5054/instr/selDevice?switch=1&port=1"  
wget -qO- "http://internal2dmz.orbit-lab.org:5054/instr/selDevice?switch=2&port=1"  
wget -qO- "http://internal2dmz.orbit-lab.org:5054/instr/selDevice?switch=3&port=1"  
wget -qO- "http://internal2dmz.orbit-lab.org:5054/instr/selDevice?switch=4&port=1"
```

to reset sb4's [programmable attenuation matrix](http://www.orbit-lab.org/wiki/Hardware/bDomains/cSandboxes/dSB4) to zero attenuation between all pairs of nodes.
