In this experiment, we will be setting up a private Tor network on GENI, and will be testing this network by listening on the traffic going through the network. We will be examining the traffic to see the functions of Tor, specifically what information can and cannot be seen when passing traffic through the Tor network.

This experiment will take approximately 30 minutes to setup, and another 20 minutes to test the network.

To reproduce this experiment on GENI, you will need an account on the [GENI Portal](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/SignMeUp), and you will need to have [joined a project](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/JoinAProject). You should have already [uploaded your SSH keys to the portal and know how to log in to a node with those keys](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/HowTo/LoginToNodes). If you're not sure if you have those skills, you may want to try [Lab Zero](http://tinyurl.com/geni-labzero) first.

## Background

Today we live in a world where the Internet is accessible from almost anything that we have in our possession. However as the Internet continues to become more expansive and accessible, the attacks on people using the Internet by spying on and stealing their information also increases. Tor is an anonymity network that is volunteer-based, where the users of the Tor network can become part of the network to increase its size and randomness. The Tor network is a system of relays that passes around a client's traffic before sending the traffic to the client's actual destination. While a client's traffic traverses through the Tor network, the origin of the traffic becomes no longer known, and the final destination is only known at the exit point of the Tor network. Also while in the Tor network, client traffic is encrypted by Tor. In this way, Tor protects users from attackers who spy on a network and try to steal a user's information.

Nowadays many sites are sent through protocols such as HTTPS in order to protect a user's privacy. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol over TLS) is a secure communication protocol used widely in the Internet, which provides authentication of accessed websites and provides privacy of the data that is exchanged between the client, web server, and the website [[1](#references)]. HTTPS provides end-to-end encryption of data so that in case an attacker is spying on the network, that attacker is not able to decrypt the information and figure out what is being transmitted. Tor works in conjunction with HTTPS, therefore the two methods combined provides end-to-end encryption of data, and protection by cloaking client and destination communication, as well as the locations of both ends.

### The Origin and History of Tor

Onion routing research began in 1995 by David Goldschlag, Michael Reed, and Paul Syverson, with one goal in mind, which was to separate identification from routing [[2](#references)]. Authenticating one's identity can be done through the data that is passed in the data stream, and does not necessarily have to be through one's location. The goal that these three men had in mind was not to create a complete form of anonymity when browsing the Internet, but anonymous routing.

Today there are over 6000 Tor relays inside the Tor network, serving over 1.5 million users [[3](#references)]. In the present day, there is a variety of Tor users with different goals that they wish to achieve from using Tor. One group of users are law enforcement and intelligence agency personnel, who must stay anonymous when browsing the Internet to investigate a certain case. Their actions cannot be traced, therefore anonymous routing is the best solution. Another group of users stems from those who want to voice their opinion on a certain topic without revealing their true identity. Tor provides a means for people to discuss and post on the Internet without a risk for exposure of their location and identity. Then there are other more ordinary people who simply want to make sure that there information is protected at a level on step higher than just HTTPS. Simply limiting the amount of information that can be seen by a person spying on the network is the main goal that people wish to achieve from using Tor.

### Overview of Tor's Security

Now let us examine what happens when we only use Tor to access a website (including a login):


![](/blog/content/images/2017/02/tor-https-2-1.png)
<small> Image Source: Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF): [Tor and HTTPS](https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https), under the [Creative Commons Attribution License](https://www.eff.org/copyright) </small>

The above network shows a number of users/nodes with different roles:

* user: the person using the network
* hacker: a malicious user who has gained access to the user's network
* NSA: a U.S. government agency
* ISP: the user's or site's Internet service provider
* site: the website, application, or other online resource that the user is accessing


We can clearly see that when using Tor, the user, the website, and those that have data sharing with the website still see all the information. The hacker, the nodes sharing data with the user's ISP, and the NSA agent with access to the user's ISP, can only see the location of the user sending traffic. They do not know the username, the data the user is sending, nor the site that the user is accessing. This is because Tor encrypts the information before it even leaves the user's computer. Tor also uses the first relay in the Tor circuit in the unencrypted "destination" field of packets sent through this part of the network, so that the site the user is accessing is also protected. The last Tor relay (the "exit relay") knows the username information, the data being sent, and the site to access because it is the exit relay's job to send the data to the site. At this point the traffic exits the Tor network and is no longer encrypted by Tor (although it may still be encrypted by HTTPS, if using HTTPS together with Tor). Mostly everything can be seen by the anyone that is eavesdropping on the network, except for one important piece of information: the user location. After having been bounced around the Tor network, the traffic no longer contains the original user's location, which makes it difficult to match which user is accessing the site. 


## Results

In this experiment, we verify that the client's location is known to the server it access when not using Tor, but is hidden from the server when it uses Tor. We also verify that the traffic that is being communicated between the client and server are encrypted and not encrypted depending on the part of the network that we listen on.

Without using Tor, when accessing the webserver that returns the client's IP address, we see:

```
Remote address: 192.168.3.100
Forwarded for:
```
192.168.3.100 is an IP address assigned to the client, indicating that its location is not protected.

When accessing the same webserver using Tor, we see that it returns the IP address of the exit relay, e.g.

```
Remote address: 192.168.12.2
Forwarded for:
```
indicating that the client's location is unknown to the server.

The following is an example to see that the location and traffic between a client and server can be seen by a person spying on the network, when the Tor network is not used. 

<iframe width="710" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FQYir-nN870" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This next example is a similar experiment to the previous example, but this time we are using the Tor network to send our client's traffic to the server. In this case, depending on the part of the network which we listen to using tcpdump, we can only see certain pieces of information about the client and server's location, and the data being communicated between the two. An important conclusion to arrive upon here is that no one node in the network can see all the information, which makes it difficult for an attacker to link who is communicating with who.

<iframe width="710" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MW2thBcGjw0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In this last example, we use a function called nload, which allows us to see all of the interfaces used by a node, and whether there is traffic going through that interface. We also use a function of Tor called Tor Arm, which is a monitor interface that displays useful information that a Tor relay can see and knows. In the beginning we use the curl function to access the web server in order to see which Tor relay is the exit relay that accesses the web server. Then Using nload, we monitor which Tor relays are being used to create a circuit in the Tor network to pass traffic as a client downloads a large text file from the server. Lastly, we use Tor Arm to find which specific circuit is the one that we are using.

## Run my experiment

First, reserve resources for the experiment. We will use the following topology:

![](/blog/content/images/2017/04/basic-tor-topology-1.svg)

In the GENI Portal, create a new slice. Load the RSpec from the following URL: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tfukui95/tor-experiment/master/basic-tor-topology.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tfukui95/tor-experiment/master/basic-tor-topology.xml). 
 
This topology is modeled after the Electronic Frontier Foundation example above: the client terminal is the user, the webserver is the Site, router-1 is the first ISP on the user side, router-3 is the second ISP on the Site side, and router-2 represents the rest of the Internet. The hacker who has access to the userâ€™s network views the network from the point of view of router-1. The NSA sees the network from the perspective of router-1, router-2, and router-3. The relays and directory server make up the Tor network. By following the EFF example, we will be able to see each playerâ€™s view of the network.

After the topology is loaded onto your canvas, click "Site", and choose an InstaGENI site to reserve our resources from. Then press Reserve Resources. When all VMs are green in the slice page, meaning that the whole topology is ready to be used, we will continue on to our next step of installing Tor onto each VM.

### Installing the Tor Software

**Do you want to set up the private Tor network quickly? Skip to the [tl;dr version](#tldrversion). Then, continue the experiment from [Testing the private Tor network](#testingtheprivatetornetwork).**

To start, we install Tor on all of the nodes *except* the web server using the following steps:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y --force-yes install tor tor-arm vim curl 
```

### Setting up the Web Server

On the node that is designated as the web server, set up Apache:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5
```

Then, we will set up a simple PHP script that returns the client's IP addresses as the homepage of the web server

```
sudo rm /var/www/html/index.html
echo '<?php' | sudo tee -a /var/www/html/index.php
echo 'echo "Remote address: " . $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] . "\n";' | sudo tee -a /var/www/html/index.php
echo 'echo "Forwarded for:  " . $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'] . "\n";' | sudo tee -a /var/www/html/index.php
echo '?>' | sudo tee -a /var/www/html/index.php
```

Finally, restart the Apache server:

```
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```

In order to monitor when someone tries to access the webserver, run the following command on the webserver:

```
sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log
```

When the client accesses the webserver, on the webserver terminal we can see the following:

```
192.168.3.100 - - [28/Apr/2017:19:39:46 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 216 "-" "curl/7.35.0"
```

which shows that the client accessed the webserver.

### Setting up the Directory Authority

Directory authorities help Tor clients learn the addresses of relays that make up the Tor network. Specifically, via the Tor documentation [[4](#references)]:

> How do clients know what the relays are, and how do they know that they have the right keys for them? Each relay has a long-term public signing key called the "identity key". Each directory authority additionally has a "directory signing key". The directory authorities provide a signed list of all the known relays, and in that list are a set of certificates from each relay (self-signed by their identity key) specifying their keys, locations, exit policies, and so on. So unless the adversary can control a majority of the directory authorities (as of 2012 there are 8 directory authorities), he can't trick the Tor client into using other Tor relays.
>
> How do clients know what the directory authorities are? The Tor software comes with a built-in list of location and public key for each directory authority. So the only way to trick users into using a fake Tor network is to give them a specially modified version of the software.

We will run a series of commands on the directory authority to set it up.

First, stop any currently running Tor process:

```
sudo pkill -9 tor
```

Next, run

```
sudo -u debian-tor mkdir /var/lib/tor/keys
sudo -u debian-tor tor-gencert --create-identity-key -m 12 -a 192.168.1.4:7000 -i /var/lib/tor/keys/authority_identity_key -s /var/lib/tor/keys/authority_signing_key -c /var/lib/tor/keys/authority_certificate
```

and enter a password when prompted. Finally, run

```
sudo -u debian-tor tor --list-fingerprint --orport 1 --dirserver "x 127.0.0.1:1 ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff" --datadirectory /var/lib/tor/
```

The output should say something like:

```
Nov 23 12:27:31.540 [notice] Your Tor server's identity key fingerprint is
'Unnamed 84F349212E57E0E33A324849E290331596BB6217' Unnamed 84F3 4921 2E57 E0E3
3A32 4849 E290 3315 96BB 6217
```

(Note: Since the debian package of Tor is owned by the debian-tor user and group, we ran the above commands as debian-tor - hence the `sudo -u debian-tor` at the beginning of each command.)

Now we'll create a configuration file for the directory authority. First, get the two fingerprints of the keys:

```
finger1=$(sudo cat /var/lib/tor/keys/authority_certificate  | grep fingerprint | cut -f 2 -d ' ')
finger2=$(sudo cat /var/lib/tor/fingerprint | cut -f 2 -d ' ')
```

Use echo to verify that the finger1 and finger2 variables now contain the fingerprints:

```
echo $finger1
echo $finger2
```

Also, get the hostname, which we will use as the Tor "nickname", with

```
HOSTNAME=$(hostname -s)
```

Then, write the config file with

```
sudo bash -c "cat >/etc/tor/torrc <<EOL
TestingTorNetwork 1

ConnLimit 60
Nickname $HOSTNAME

ContactInfo auth0@test.test
ExitPolicy reject *:*
TestingV3AuthInitialVotingInterval 300
TestingV3AuthInitialVoteDelay 20
TestingV3AuthInitialDistDelay 20
EOL"
```


Note: See [[5](#references)] for background on writing a multi-line file with variables, and [[6](#references)] for background on using cat to write a multi-line file to a protected file.

Use

```
sudo cat /etc/tor/torrc
```

to make sure that the correct variables are written to the config file.

Since the relay and client config files also need the directory server's fingerprints in them, we'll generate them on the directory server (which knows its own fingerprints). We'll download them to the individual relay and client nodes and customize them later.

Install apache2, in order to write the relay and client config files and then transfer them over HTTP:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install apache2
```

Next write the relay config file with

```
sudo bash -c "cat >/var/www/html/relay.conf <<EOL
TestingTorNetwork 1
DataDirectory /var/lib/tor
RunAsDaemon 1
ConnLimit 60
ShutdownWaitLength 0

OrPort 5000
ControlPort 9051

# An exit policy that allows exiting to IPv4 LAN
ExitPolicy accept 192.168.0.0/16:*
EOL"
```

This command on the directory authority creates a generic config file for all relays, which can then be copied over to a relay. The file is saved in `/var/www/html/relay.conf` and can be seen by

```
sudo cat /var/www/html/relay.conf
```

Then, write the client config file with

```
sudo bash -c "cat >/var/www/html/client.conf <<EOL
TestingTorNetwork 1
DataDirectory /var/lib/tor
RunAsDaemon 1
ConnLimit 60

```

This command on the directory authority creates a generic config file for clients, which can then be copied over to a client node. The file is saved in `/var/www/html/client.conf` and can be seen by

```
cat /var/www/html/client.conf
```

Finally, start Tor with

```
sudo /etc/init.d/tor start
```

From running

```
sudo cat /var/log/tor/debug.log | grep "Trusted"
```

to search the log file, we see a line

```
Nov 09 11:03:02.000 [debug] parse_dir_authority_line(): Trusted 100 dirserver
at 192.168.1.4:7000 (CA36BEB3CDA5028BDD7B1E1F743929A81E26A5AA)
```

which indicates that we are using our directory authority at 192.168.1.4 (the current host).

### Setting up a Relay

To set up the relays, run the following series of commands on each one.

First, stop any currently running Tor process:

```
sudo /etc/init.d/tor stop
```

Generate fingerprints as the debian-tor user with:

```
sudo -u debian-tor tor --list-fingerprint --orport 1 --dirserver "x 127.0.0.1:1 ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff" --datadirectory /var/lib/tor/
```

The output should say something like:

```
Nov 23 12:34:00.137 [notice] Your Tor server's identity key fingerprint is
'Unnamed D2EB9948027BF5795FCA85182869FBFAA7C15B4C' Unnamed D2EB 9948 027B F579
5FCA 8518 2869 FBFA A7C1 5B4C
```

Download the generic relay config file that we created on the directory server:

```
sudo wget -O /etc/tor/torrc http://directoryserver/relay.conf
```

Now, we'll add some extra config settings that are different on each relay node: the nickname and the address.

Add the nickname and address with

```
HOSTNAME=$(hostname -s)
echo "Nickname $HOSTNAME" | sudo tee -a /etc/tor/torrc
ADDRESS=$(hostname -I | tr " " "\n" | grep "192.168")
echo "Address $ADDRESS" | sudo tee -a /etc/tor/torrc
```

Now, if you look at the contents of the config file on the relay:

```
sudo cat /etc/tor/torrc
```

you should see a couple of lines like

```
Nickname relay1
Address 192.168.12.2
```

at the end.

Finally, start the Tor service on the relay node with

```
sudo /etc/init.d/tor restart
```

After a few minutes, we can check to see if the routers are beginning to be made aware of each other on the private Tor network by accessing the info.log file which we defined earlier in the torrc configuration file of each node. If each of the routers is to be made aware of each other, a TLS handshake must take place. For example if we want to check whether relay3 has recognized relay2 and has performed a handshake, if relay 2 is running on 192.168.12.2, on the relay3 terminal we run:

```
sudo cat /var/log/tor/info.log | grep "192.168.12.2"
```

and we should see some output like:

```
Apr 18 13:25:12.000 [info] channel_tls_process_versions_cell(): Negotiated version 4 with 192.168.12.2:5000; Sending cells: CERTS
Apr 18 13:25:12.000 [info] channel_tls_process_certs_cell(): Got some good certificates from 192.168.12.2:5000: Authenticated it.
Apr 18 13:25:12.000 [info] channel_tls_process_auth_challenge_cell(): Got an AUTH_CHALLENGE cell from 192.168.12.2:5000: Sending authentication
Apr 18 13:25:12.000 [info] channel_tls_process_netinfo_cell(): Got good NETINFO cell from 192.168.12.2:5000; OR connection is now open, using protocol version 4. Its ID digest is 4EDC07C69A02236F13A8C6E0261F23B618D5ED19. Our address is apparently 192.168.13.2.
```

We can see that first the version is negotiated, and then relay3 sends a CERTS cell. After receiving a CERTS cell and AUTH_CHALLENGE from relay2, relay3 authenticates, and then both send a NETINFO cell, confirming their location and timestamp. We can see that the following handshake that they have used to establish their connection is the In-Protocol handshake.


### Setting up a client

Finally, we will run a series of commands on the client node to set it up.

First, stop any currently running Tor process:

```
sudo /etc/init.d/tor stop
```

Then, generate fingerprints as the debian-tor user with:

```
sudo -u debian-tor tor --list-fingerprint --orport 1 --dirserver "x 127.0.0.1:1 ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff" --datadirectory /var/lib/tor/
```

The output should say something like:

```
Nov 23 13:25:30.877 [notice] Your Tor server's identity key fingerprint is
'Unnamed 4BD9274359B639B5E812913A9B1962BD84BABFFF' Unnamed 4BD9 2743 59B6 39B5
E812 913A 9B19 62BD 84BA BFFF
```

Download the client config file (that we created on the directory server) to the default Tor config file location with:

```
sudo wget -O /etc/tor/torrc http://directoryserver/client.conf
```

Add the nickname and address(es) with

```
HOSTNAME=$(hostname -s)
echo "Nickname $HOSTNAME" | sudo tee -a /etc/tor/torrc
ADDRESS=$(hostname -I | tr " " "\n" | grep "192.168")
echo "Address $ADDRESS" | sudo tee -a /etc/tor/torrc
```

Finally, start the Tor service on the client node with

```
sudo /etc/init.d/tor restart
```

## Testing the Private Tor Network

In order to clearly see the benefits of using the Tor network, we must first run a test to see what information can be seen by a hacker when not using Tor.

### Testing the Network Without Using Tor

In order to access the webserver without going through the Tor network, we simply run

```
curl http://webserver/
```

on the client, and verify that the server returns the client's IP address. You should see something like

```
Remote address: 192.168.3.100
Forwarded for:
```

From this we can see how that the webserver is telling us that the VM that accessed the webserver is the client, which shows that the client and webserver are directly communicating with each other.

Next we will be using Tcpdump to watch the traffic on the network. We want Tcpdump to both display the output to screen while also saving the output to a file. The following is the format

```
sudo tcpdump -s 1514 -i eth1 'port <port_num>' -U -w - | tee <name_file>.pcap | tcpdump -nnxxXSs 1514 -r -
```

where "port\_num" is the specific port number to access, and "name\_file" is the name that you want to save the file as.

Since we are not using the Tor network, we will be listening on port 80 which is the most common HTTP port. Have two client terminals opened, and on one, start listening through port 80 by running

```
sudo tcpdump -s 1514 -i eth1 'port 80' -U -w - | tee clientnotor.pcap | tcpdump -nnxxXSs 1514 -r -
```

On the web server terminal also listen through port 80 by running

```
sudo tcpdump -s 1514 -i eth1 'port 80' -U -w - | tee servernotor.pcap | tcpdump -nnxxXSs 1514 -r -
```

On the other client terminal, access the webserver by running

```
curl http://webserver/
```

On both terminals that are listening on the network, we should see something like

```
IP 192.168.3.100.38826 > 192.168.2.200.80
IP 192.168.2.200.80 > 192.168.3.100.38826
```

which shows how we can see that the client and webserver are communicating directly with each other. On the right-hand side of the output we should see something like

```
GET./.HTTPS/1.1..User-Agent:.curl/7.35.0..Host:.webserver..Accept:. */*
```

which is a request to access the webserver, and something like

```
Content-Length:.47..Content-Type:.text/html....Remote.address:.192.168.3.100.Forwarded.for:...
```

which is the output of the curl command that we ran earlier. This shows how we can see exactly what traffic they are passing to each other. If any other node in between the client and webserver, for example router-1, listens on port 80, they can also see the same traffic. We can conclude how communicating only through HTTP allows a person spying on this network to see who is communicating with who, and what specifically is being communicated. This form is communication is very risky and prone to getting your information stolen.

### Testing the Network Using Tor

Now we will test the same curl experiment of accessing the web server, now through the Tor network. Then we will compare the results with when we do not use Tor.

First we need to find the exit relay that is being used in the Tor network, which serves as the relay that sends the data packet to the webserver. In order to do this we run (on the client)

```
curl -x socks5://127.0.0.1:9050/ http://webserver/
```

and verify that when using the Tor network (through the SOCKS proxy), the server does not know the client's IP address; it returns the IP address of the exit relay. You should see something like

```
Remote address: 192.168.11.2
Forwarded for:
```

Clearly the returned address is not the client's IP address, but the IP address of a Tor relay that we set up. This relay is the exit relay of the circuit that is being used.

We can see who and when someone accesses the webserver by running

```
sudo su
tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log
```

and then running the curl command again. We should see an output like the following:

```
192.168.3.100 - - [28/Apr/2017:19:39:46 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 216 "-" "curl/7.35.0"
```

Our next step is to figure out which Tor circuit is being used to access the webserver. This can be done using Tor Arm (anonymizing relay monitor), a program which serves as a terminal status monitor of Tor [[7](#references)]. Arm provides useful statistics such as bandwidth, cpu, and memory usage, as well as known connections, and the Tor configuration file. Another program which we will use is nload, which allows us to see whenever there is traffic going through a specific interface.

First on router-2, we install nload, then start running it

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nload
nload
``` 

We install nload on router-2 because router-2 is connected with all of the Tor relays, therefore we can identify which specific Tor relays are being used by observing the traffic that router-2 can see.

Next we will generate a large text file on the webserver. On the webserver run

```
sudo su
base64 /dev/urandom | head -c 10000000 > /var/www/html/file.txt
```

Now from the client terminal we will download the large text file from the webserver

```
curl -x socks5://127.0.0.1:9050/ -s http://webserver/file.txt > /dev/null
```

There will be no output on the screen for the client as it is downloading. However on router-2 which is running nload, we should see something similar to the following on some of the interfaces as we flip through each interface:

```
.||..|||||....|||||    Max: 9.28 MBit/s
.###################|  Curr: 0.00 Bit/s
```

This signifies that the interface is being used. To figure out which interface correlates to which relay in the Tor network, we look at the IP address of the interface:

* 192.168.11.1 -> relay1
* 192.168.12.1 -> relay2
* 192.168.13.1 -> relay3
* 192.168.1.1 -> directoryserver
* 192.168.15.1 -> relay5
* 192.168.16.1 -> relay6

The other interfaces can be ignored, such as the one for 192.168.10.2, which is the interface for router-1 or router-3. The three relays in which you see that there is traffic going through are the relays being used in the Tor network to access the website and through which the file is being downloaded. In order to see which circuit specifically is being used, we use Tor Arm. Run Arm on the client:

```
sudo -u debian-tor arm
```

We can see a running display of bandwidth, cpu, and memory usage. On the client's Arm window, if we flip to the second page we can see the Tor circuits that are available to pass traffic. Since we found out which relay is serving as the exit node before, we should be able to see the circuit that lists that information. Make sure that the other two relays are also listed as the guard and middle relays. This circuit is the one that is being used to pass the client's traffic to the webserver, and vice-versa.

### Using Tcpdump to Watch Traffic

We will again be using tcpdump to listen to the network at different locations:

* On the client, between the web browser and the SOCKS proxy used to "Tor-ify" the traffic.
* On the router that passes traffic between the client and the Tor relays.
* On each relay in the circuit.
* On the web server.

We will require two terminals for the clients for this part. On one, run

<pre>
sudo tcpdump -s 1514 -i any 'port 9050' -U -w - | tee client9050.pcap | tcpdump -nnxxXSs 1514 -r -
</pre>

to watch the traffic that is going through the SOCKS proxy port 9050, and then save what it sees in a pcap file called client9050.pcap (see [[8](#references)]). The SOCKS proxy is the proxy that is used for the client and the onion proxy to communicate with each other. This communication is over a loop-back interface. 

On router-1 run

<pre>
sudo tcpdump -s 1514 -i eth1 'port 5000' -U -w - | tee ISPone5000.pcap | tcpdump -nnxxXSs 1514 -r -
</pre>

to watch the traffic through port 5000, which is the port to listen on the Tor network. This would mean that we would be listening on any traffic that is being transferred from the client to the Tor network. Specifically, this communication would be between the client and the entry relay that is being used when the traffic enters the Tor network.

Next on each relay that is being used in the circuit, run

<pre>
sudo tcpdump -s 1514 -i eth1 'port 5000' -U -w - | tee $(hostname -s).pcap | tcpdump -nnxxXSs 1514 -r -
</pre>

where **$(hostname -s)** will be converted automatically to the name of the specific relay that you are working with. For example, if using tcpdump on relay1, the file that tcpdump will write to will be relay1.pcap. This tcpdump function will watch the traffic that is going through the OR port 5000, and then save what it sees in a pcap file.

On router-3, we listen on port 80, which is the most commonly used port for HTTP. Listening on port 80 at router-3 represents the traffic after having going through the Tor network, and before reaching the webserver. We run

<pre>
sudo tcpdump -s 1514 -i eth1 'port 80' -U -w - | tee ISPtwo80.pcap | tcpdump -nnxxXSs 1514 -r -
</pre>

to start listening on the network through port 80.

Lastly we must also set up the web server to have it listen for traffic as well. On the web server terminal run

<pre>
sudo tcpdump -s 1514 -i eth1 'port 80' -U -w - | tee webserver.pcap | tcpdump -nnxxXSs 1514 -r -
</pre>

to start listening for traffic on port 80.

Now at this point we should have seven terminals listening on a network. These terminals are the client, router-1, three ORs being used in the circuit, router-3 terminal, and the web server.

Next on the second client terminal, we run

```
curl -x socks5://127.0.0.1:9050/ -s http://webserver/file.txt > /dev/null
```

to download the large text file on the webserver. Since we are using the Tor network to access the site, the three ORs must have seen some kind of traffic passing through it. Now let us take a look at what the client and each OR saw. Stop the tcpdump process with Ctrl^C. When we stop tcpdump, a file is created with the traffic that was seen passing through. If you want to access the saved file to see the traffic on Wireshark's interface, follow the steps in the section about setting up Wireshark. Otherwise, as we listen on the network, the traffic that we can see will be outputted on the display of each terminal.

### Summary of Experiment

From using tcpdump when using and not using Tor, there is a clear difference in the information that we can and cannot see at each node. When not using Tor, and using the direct link between the client and web server, all information can be seen. Clearly we know that the client and the web server knows who it is communicating with, and the packet contents that are being sent. However, what is dangerous is that any attacker that is listening on the same network can see all the information that both ends of the network can also see. This leads to easy spying, stealing of information and privacy, and may lead to a virus since the attacker knows your location and what site you visit.

When we communicate while using the Tor network:

* the client address can be seen in the beginning, where the entry relay is the last node which knows the client address. The reason why the change occurs here is because this is the point where the packet enters the Tor network. 
* Inside the Tor network, including the entry and exit relays, each relay only knows who sent it the packet and who to send the packet to next. Therefore the entry relay gets the packet from the client, and knows to send it to the middle relay, but once it gets to the middle relay, the middle relay only knows that it got the packet from the entry relay and does not know anything about the client who originally sent the packet. Therefore from that point the
client address is no longer known.
* The web server address is not known towards the beginning, until it reaches the exit relay and while listening through port 80. The reason why the web server address is not known until this point is due to the encryption that is done by the onion proxy at the beginning. When the packet reaches the exit relay, the exit relay decrypts the last layer of encryption and at that point, the location of the webserver is first known. Since the exit relay is responsible for sending the packet to the web server, who can't decrypt any kind of Tor encryption, the web server address as well as the packet contents are unencrypted.
* The nodes which can see the unencrypted packet data are the nodes at the beginning and the end of the circuit. In order words, the nodes that are inside the Tor network cannot see the packet contents, because the information is encrypted while traveling inside the Tor network, and the ends of the circuit cannot decrypt Tor encryption so the information must be unencrypted at the ends.

One of the most important conclusions to arrive upon from this experiment is that when using the Tor network, there is no one node that knows the whole mapping of the circuit. Therefore even if one node, say for example one of the Tor relays gets taken control over, the relay only knows who gave it the packet and who it needs to send it to, and nothing else. As long as no too many nodes get taken over, anonymity will definitely stay intact. This is the power of Tor, in being able to cloak client and web server communication as well as their locations and actual packet contents while the packet traverses through the Tor network.

## tl;dr version

These instructions will show you how to save the script file from my [Github](https://github.com/tfukui95/tor-experiment) for each of the nodes, to quickly set up the Tor network. 

The order in which the VMs are set up is very important. Making sure that the directory server is set up first before any of the other nodes is vital for the private Tor network to be set up properly, as the Tor configuration files for the rest of the nodes are first created in the directory server. Once the directory server is set up, the order of setup of the other VMs is flexible. 

To setup the directory server, go to the directory server VM and run

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tfukui95/tor-experiment/master/wfp-directoryserver.sh
bash wfp-directoryserver.sh
```
You will have to enter a password when prompted, then hit Enter, re-enter the password, and hit Enter again to finish the setup:

```
Enter PEM pass phrase:
Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:
```

After that is finished, let us setup the webserver, relays, and client VMs. On the webserver run

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tfukui95/tor-experiment/master/wfp-webserver.sh
bash wfp-webserver.sh
```

On each of the relays run

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tfukui95/tor-experiment/master/wfp-router.sh
bash wfp-router.sh
```

Lastly on the client VM run

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tfukui95/tor-experiment/master/wfp-client.sh
bash wfp-client.sh
```

Now that all the VMs are setup, reconfirm that the private Tor network is up and running by using Tor Arm on each of the nodes:

```
sudo -u debian-tor arm
```

## Notes

Before restarting Tor, you must kill the current Tor process first, and then restart Tor.

```
sudo pkill -9 tor
sudo /etc/init.d/tor restart
```

It is good practice to restart Tor whenever you haven't used the Tor network for a few hours or so, in order to recreate the circuits.


To run the Tor monitor, use

```
sudo -u debian-tor arm
```

Use the left and right arrow keys to switch between different screens.
Use `q` to quit.

There are other methods in which we can see the information that is being passed along the circuit of the Tor network. However these methods require additional installations of programs, and will be listed in this section as an
additional resource.

One such method to get more information about circuits available and about which exit relay is used for each connection, is to use a couple of Python utility
scripts.

Another method is an addition to tcpdump, which allows for a better and more organized window to analyze the packets that are being passed along the Tor network. This method requires Wireshark. Wireshark is a software that can read in a file written by tcpdump, and displays the traffic very neatly to allow better observation of the data.

### Using Python Utility Scripts

First, install some prerequisites:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install python-pip
sudo pip install stem
```

Then, you can download the utility scripts with

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tfukui95/tor-experiment/master/utilities/exit-relay.py
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tfukui95/tor-experiment/master/utilities/list-circuits.py
```

To see what circuits your Tor client is currently aware of, run

```
sudo python list-circuits.py
```

To see what exit relay is associated with an outgoing connection, you'll need two terminals open to the client node. On one, run

```
sudo python exit-relay.py
```

to start monitoring. On another, make an outgoing connection with

```
curl -x socks5://127.0.0.1:9050/ http://webserver/                              
```

and in the first terminal, look for a message like

```
Exit relay for our connection to 192.168.2.1:80
  address: 192.168.1.3:5000
  fingerprint: B1A2C989985CD3C95C0D6C17B0A64A38007F90FB
  nickname: relay3
  locale: ??
```

### Setting up Wireshark

Wireshark can be downloaded from the company's [homepage](https://www.wireshark.org/). Besides downloading and installing the software, there is no often configuration
necessary.

After we have ran tcpdump on all of our required nodes and created the pcap files, we can use SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) to save all of our files from our remote Linux terminal to our local machine. We go to our GENI slice page, and click Details to get more information of our client VM. We then open up a local terminal and go to any folder to save our pcap files to. The SCP command for saving the image to our local machine is the following:

```
scp -P <port_number> <user>@<site_address>:~/*.pcap . 
```

Where *.pcap is a wildcard to indicate all of the pcap files that we have saved on our client terminal. After having saved our pcap files to our local machine, we can open them up on Wireshark to see the traffic captures.

### Editor's notes

This text was updated in July 2018 to use Tor version 0.2.4. It may require changes to work with later Tor versions.
